    description: >
      Starting at #{ordinal} level, a bodger can whack things until
      they start working. When making a melee attack on a construct, you
      can choose to subtract your Dexterity modifier from your damage
      instead of adding it. When you do so, if the damage total would
      be negative, it acts as healing of the same magnitude. If your
      weapon is magical, its damage bonus is suppressed when using this
      power.

  ### Field Maintenance

  The bodger's specialty is getting it to work, now. It might not work again
  tomorrow, it might not work as well as it used to, but when you need it
  working within five minutes, the bodger is your best bet.

  flavortext: >
    While bodgers start out as undisciplined tinkers, with time they develop
    a more philosophical approach to their work, resulting in adhering to one
    of the bodger schools of thought about machine maintenance. The school is
    selected at 3rd level.

      maintenance is to hit something hard enough that it starts working
      immediately.
