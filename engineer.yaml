features:
  - name: repair specialist
    level: 1
    description: >
      Starting at #{ordinal} level, you can repair mechanika, machines,
      and warjacks. You get a pool of repair dice, equal to 1d8 per engineer
      level. These dice can be used to repair machines, mechanika, and
      warjacks during a short rest. During a long rest, you regain repair
      dice equal to half your pool (minimum 1), but can't have more than
      your total pool.
  - name: tool use
    level: 1
    description: >
      Starting at #{ordinal} level, you are proficient in the use of
      mechanik's tools as weapons.  You can use Dexterity instead of
      Strength for attack and damage rolls with tools.
  - name: extra attack
    level: 5
    description: >
      At #{ordinal} level, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack
      action on your turn.
  - name: focused expertise
    level: 5
    description: >
      By #{ordinal} level, your mastery of skills and tools produces exceptional
      results. If your proficiency modifier would apply to a check both because
      of the tools used and because of the skill used, your proficiency bonus is
      doubled for that check.
  - name: technical jargon
    level: 2
    description: >
      By #{ordinal} level, you have learned the dense technical jargon used
      by engineers to communicate. When talking with any engineer with whom
      you share a language, you can exchange information about constructs
      and mechanikal devices in half the time it would take to communicate
      such things normally. This is impenetrable jargon to anyone who has
      not learned it, either from training as an engineer or by adding it
      as a known language.
  - name: engineering school
    level: 3
    description: >
      When you reach #{ordinal} level, you select an engineering school
      reflecting your focus and specialization within the field. This
      grants you additional class features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th,
      and 20th levels.

      When you reach #{ordinal} level, you can take the Help action
      as a bonus action on each of your turns.
  - name: use magic device
    level: 6
    description: >
      Engineers are skilled in the use and maintenance of magical and
      mechanikal devices, and can use them regardless of restrictions on
      class or race beginning at #{ordinal} level.
  - name: magical mending
    level: 8
    description: >
      At #{ordinal} level you learn the _mending_ cantrip if you do not
      already know it. This does not count against your spells known for any
      class.
  - name: improved repair
    level: 9
    description: >
      Beginning at #{ordinal} level, when you use dice from your repair
      pool during a short rest, you add your proficiency bonus to each die
      to determine total healing.
  - name: mechanikal expertise
    level: 10
    description: >
      Starting at #{ordinal} level, when making any skill or ability
      check to identify, understand, repair, or disable a construct,
      trap, or mechanikal device, you treat any roll of 9 or lower
      as a 10.

flavortext: >
  A gobber stands behind a warjack, whacking it with a wrench and yelling
  "I don't have *time* to take you apart, so you're just going to have to
  start working *now*." He gives it a particularly solid blow with the
  wrench, and its eyes light up.

  A grime-covered human, barely large enough to be an adult, sits in her
  workshop, surrounded by parts which practically leap into her hands as she
  puts them together.

  A dwarf carefully chisels additional runes into a warjack, muttering about
  the stability of a magical field.

  Where there are mechanika or simpler machines to be maintained, there are
  probably engineers maintaining them. They spend their days elbow-deep in
  machinery, and are united in a passionate love for getting machines to
  do things, regardless of their preferred approach.
archetype_meta:
  singular: engineer school
  plural: engineer schools
  flavortext: >
    While engineers generally start out as casual tinkers, with time they
    develop a more philosophical approach to their work, adhering to one
    of the engineering schools of thought about machine maintenance. The
    school is selected at 3rd level.
archetypes:
  school of hard knocks:
    flavortext: >
      The school of hard knocks focuses on immediate maintenance, with a
      specialty of whacking things until they start working. Mechanika not
      working yet? You probably need a bigger hammer, or a bigger bodger.
      The bodger's specialty is getting it to work, now. It might not work
      again tomorrow, it might not work as well as it used to, but when you
      need it working within five minutes, the bodger is your best bet.
    features:
      - name: percussive maintenance
        level: 3
        description: >
          Starting at #{ordinal} level, a bodger can whack things until
          they start working. As an action, you can make a melee attack on a
          construct, mechanika, or warjack with any tool. If the attack hits,
          you subtract (instead of adding) your Dexterity modifier from the
          damage total, and also subtract your proficiency bonus from the damage
          total. If the damage total becomes negative, it acts as healing.
          If your weapon is magical, its bonus is subtracted from damage when
          using this power.
      - name: field repair
        level: 7
        description: >
          At #{ordinal} level, you can use one die from your repair pool
          when using the Percussive Maintenance ability. This healing applies
          even if the attack misses.
      - name: rapid percussion
        level: 11
        description: >
          Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can use the Percussive Maintenance
          ability as a bonus action on your turn.
      - name: upside the head
        level: 15
        description: >
          At #{ordinal} level, you have learned to whack creatures upside
          the head to clear or muddy their senses.  As an action, you can
          make a melee attack against a creature with any tool. If the
          attack hits, it deals no damage, but you can choose to give the
          creature advantage, or disadvantage, on all Intelligence, Wisdom,
          and Charisma saving throws and ability checks for one minute. If
          you give the creature advantage on these saving throws, and it is
          affected by any ongoing effect which could be ended by such a
          saving throw, it can use its reaction make a saving throw to end
          the effect. If it is affected by more than one such effect, it
          can choose which one to try to end.
  school of arcana:
    flavortext: >
      The school of arcana focuses more specifically on the hybrid of magic
      and mechanical function, and students of this school are called arcane
      mechaniks.
    features:
      - name: mechanikal attunement
        level: 3
        description: >
          Starting at #{ordinal} level, you can maintain attunements for
          mechanika, allowing yourself or other people to use them. When
          you take a long rest, you pick a number of mechanika up to your
          proficiency bonus. These mechanika are considered "charged" for
          24 hours, and function as attuned for any wielder during that time.
          These attunements do not count towards your personal limit of three
          attuned magic items.
      - name: fast attunement
        level: 7
        description: >
          Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can charge one mechanikal
          device during a short rest, making it effectively "attuned" for any
          user until your next long rest. You must complete a long rest before
          you can use this feature again. This usage is still subject to your
          normal limit on providing charges for mechanikal devices.
      - name: temporary attunement
        level: 11
        description: >
          Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can attune items temporarily.
          As an action, you can charge one mechanikal device, allowing
          yourself or anyone else to use it as though it were attuned. This
          attunement lasts for one minute. You must complete a short rest
          before using this power again.
      - name: lasting attunement
        level: 15
        description: >
          At #{ordinal} level, your ability to charge mechanikal items has
          improved and no longer requires constant reapplication.
          While you live, items you have charged remain charged without the
          need for daily reattunement. During a long rest, you can pick new
          items to attune, and items you do not wish to continue maintaining
          lose their attunement.
      - name: personal attunement
        level: 20
        description: >
          At #{ordinal} level, any item you personally wield in your hands
          is considered attuned to you while you wield it. This does not
          count against any limits on attuned items.
  school of design:
    flavortext: >
      Students of the school of design are focused on the development of
      new devices, but have significant ability to maintain and alter devices
      already built by others. To pursue this research, they develop the
      ability to run "prototypes", which function like mechanika, but do not
      need normal attunement. However, they will not function for anyone
      but their creator.
    features:
      - name: functional prototype
        level: 3
        description: >
          When you select this school at #{ordinal} level, you gain the
          ability to maintain mechanika of your own design. Your first
          project is a functional prototype which is effectively a
          mechanikal familiar. You learn the _find familiar_ spell and can
          cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against any limits
          on spells known.  Your familiar, which is called your "functional
          prototype", may take one of the normal forms, or one of the
          following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, sprite.

          However, your functional prototype differs from the standard
          familiars in that whatever form it takes, it is actually a
          construct (rather than a beast, celestial, fey, or fiend). If
          your functional protoytype is reduced to zero hit points, it is
          destroyed, and you must remake it (by casting the spell again.)

          Your functional prototype's hit point maximum equals its
          normal maximum or three times your engineer level, whichever is
          higher.
      - name: enhanced prototype
        level: 7
        description: >
          At #{ordinal} level, you have learned to add functionality to your
          prototype. During a long rest, you can attune a mechanikal device to
          your functional prototype. The device then functions normally as an
          attuned item for either you or your functional prototype, but does
          not count against your normal limit of attuned items. However,
          if your functional prototype is destroyed, the item also ceases to
          be attuned.
      - name: combat prototype
        level: 11
        description: >
          Starting at #{ordinal} level, your functional prototype gains your
          proficiency bonus to attack rolls, armor class, and all saving throws.
          Also, your functional prototype can take the Attack action.
      - name: advanced prototype
        level: 15
        description: >
          Beginning at #{ordinal} level, when your functional prototype is
          damaged but has any hit points remaining, it regains five hit
          points on each of its turns. If it is reduced to zero hit points,
          your functional prototype is not immediately destroyed.  Instead,
          it is incapacitated. As an action, if you are within five feet of
          it, you can restore it to one hit point. If it remains
          incapacitated for a minute, it is destroyed. Also, you can now
          keep two mechanikal devices attuned to your functional prototype.
      - name: prototype reserve
        level: 20
        description: >
          When you reach #{ordinal} level, you can maintain additional
          prototypes in reserve, ready to be activated as needed. As an action,
          you can cast _find familiar_ to replace your existing
          prototype. The replacement can start out attuned to up to two
          mechanikal devices. You must finish a short rest before using this
          feature again.
