5e-compatible class definitions

The intent here is to allow a reasonably simple block of human-editable
text to be used to generate reasonably pretty HTML class descriptions.

Data format: YAML

Top-level: scalars to scalars, in general
	version: 0.1 -- will change in updated specs
	name: class's name (e.g., "rogue")
	hitdie: d8
	abilityincreases: Ability increases (default 4/8/12/16)
	casting: 1, 1/2, or 1/3 for full, half, or 1/3 casters.
	  Special cases spell out by hand, omit if no casting.
	proficiency_{armor,weapons,tools,saves}: self-explanatory
	proficiency_skills: [N, list, of, skills], where N is the number to pick
	equipment: [list of items]. If an item is itself a list, it is an
	  [(a) or (b)] list.
	features:
	  array of class features. each feature is
	  name:
	  level:
	  description:
	  Features will go in the [features] column.
	  You don't need to list ability increases separately.
	  You can include #{levelth} in the description to get the ordinal of
	  the level the feature is set to.
	extra_features:
	  hash mapping column headings to arrays of (20) data points.
	  These don't get listed under Class Features in general.
	  For something like sneak attack, have a general features entry
	  at 1st level, and then an extra_features column.
	extra_features_after:
	  Same as extra_features, but listed after the main Features column.
	flavortext: Introductory flavortext.
	creating_a: Flavortext for character creation
	quick_build: [ability, ability, background]
	quick_build_extra: Additional text such as spell selection.
	archetype_meta:
          hash, containing "singular", "plural", and "flavortext".  "singular"
	  and "plural" is where you'd put things like "roguish
	  archetype"/"roguish archetypes" or "monastic tradition"/"monastic
	  traditions".
        archetypes:
	  hash of archetype names, each of which maps toa  sub-hash containing
	  "flavortext" (what it sounds like) and "features", which is an array
	  of features like the features list. You should also have an entry
	  in the main "features" list for picking your archetype.
