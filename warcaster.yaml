features:
- name: Spellcasting
  level: 1
  description: >
    At #{ordinal} level, choose either the bard, cleric, druid,
    sorceror, or wizard spell list.  Your casting stat is the same as the class whose
    spell list you are using.  You know two cantrips from that spell list.  You do not
    need a spellbook, even if you are using wizard spells.  When you reach 2nd
    level, you gain the ability to also cast spells that are not cantrips.  See chapter
    10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for spell lists.

    ####Spell Slots

    The Warcaster table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
    of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
    the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you
    finish a long rest.

    ####Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

    At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from your chosen
    spell list.    

    The Spells Known column of the Warcaster table shows when you learn more
    spells of your choice.  Each of these spells must be of a level for which you
    have spell slots.  For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can
    learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.    

    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
    spells you know and replace it with another spell from your chosen spell list,
    which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.
- name: Fighting Style
  level: 2
  description: >
    At #{ordinal} level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
    speciality.  Choose one of the following options.  You can't take a Fighting Style
    option more than once, even if you get to choose again later.

    ####Defense

    While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC

    ####Dueling

    When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other melee
    weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

    ####Great Weapon Fighting

    When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee
    weapon that you are wielding in two hands, you can reroll the die and must
    use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.  The weapon must have the
    two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

    ####Gunnery

    You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

    ####Two-Weapon Fighting

    When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier
    to the damage of the second attack.
- name: Sense Cortex
  level: 3
  description: >
    Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can sense 'jack cortices within 20 feet and
    know whether or not they are active and whether or not they are currently
    being marshalled or controlled by a warcaster.  By using your action, you can
    expand this range to 100 feet for one round.
- name: Jack Commander
  level: 3
  description: >
    At 3rd level, you gain a warjack that accompanies you on your adventures and
    fights alongside you.  Work with your DM to select and stat out a light warjack.
    Add your proficiency bonus to the 'jack's attack rolls and damage rolls.  A
    'jack is extremely difficult to destroy completely, but if it suffers an amount of
    damage greater than 20 + four times your warcaster level, arcane feedback
    prevents you from controlling it until it has been repaired to within this limit
    and you have used an action to re-establish your link.    
    The 'jack obeys your commands as best it can.  It takes its turn on your
    initiative, but does not take an action unless you command it to.  On your turn,
    you can command the 'jack where to move without using an action.  You can
    use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or
    Help action.  Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one
    weapon attack yourself when you command your 'jack to take the Attack action.
- name: Extra Attack
  level: 5
  description: >
    Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
    you take the Attack action on your turn.
- name: Arcantrik Resilience
  level: 6
  description: >
    Starting at #{ordinal} level, you can add your proficiency bonus to
    concentration checks.
- name: Power Field
  level: 10
  description: >
    Starting at #{ordinal} level, if you do not cast a spell or have a 'jack use the
    Attack action during your turn, you receive a +2 bonus to AC until the beginning of
    your next turn.  If you are wearing warcaster armor, it is instead increased by the
    level of your highest unused spell slot (minimum 2).
- name: Reinforced Power Field
  level: 14
  description: >
    Beginning at #{ordinal} level, your Power Field can activate even if you do order a
    'jack to use the Attack action.  In addition, if you are wearing warcaster armor,
    whenever your Power Field activates, you also gain  temporary hit points equal to
    the AC increase until the beginning of your next turn.
- name: Arcantrik Senses
  level: 18
  description: >
    At #{ordinal} level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures
    you can't see.  When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability
    to see it does not impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.  
    You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet
    of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded
    or deafened.
- name: Overdrive
  level: 20
  description: >
    At #{ordinal} level, you can imbue your 'jack with a brief burst of energy.  Once on
    each of your turns, you can add your casting stat modifier to the attack roll or
    the damage roll of an attack made by a 'jack you are controlling.  You can
    choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the
    roll are applied.

  Warcasters are a rare type of caster, but they have slowly become more common.  In
  some few people, magical ability also brings the ability to mentally connect to the cortex
  of a steamjack and control it almost as an extension of the caster's body.  The Iron
  Kingdoms have hurried to militarize this talent, and those who have it quickly find
  themselves caught up in the various bloody conflicts raging across western Immoren.

archetype_meta:
  singular: warcaster specialization
  plural: warcaster specializations
  flavortext: >
    All warcasters can control warjacks, but how they use them varies greatly
    from one caster to another.  Some are great warriors in their own right and see
    their 'jacks merely as support pieces, some dedicate themselves to controlling
    their 'jacks as efficiently and effectively as they can, and others use their 'jacks
    to keep them safe while they stand in the back and provide magical support.
