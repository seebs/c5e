  - name: Spellcasting
    level: 1
    description: >
      At #{ordinal} level, choose either the bard, cleric, druid,
      sorceror, or wizard spell list.  Your casting stat is the same as the class whose
      spell list you are using.  You know two cantrips from that spell list.  You do not
      need a spellbook, even if you are using wizard spells.  When you reach 2nd
      level, you gain the ability to also cast spells that are not cantrips.  See chapter
      10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for spell lists.

      #### Spell Slots

      The Warcaster table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
      of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
      the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you
      finish a long rest.

      #### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

      At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from your chosen
      spell list.  

      The Spells Known column of the Warcaster table shows when you learn more
      spells of your choice.  Each of these spells must be of a level for which you
      have spell slots.  For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can
      learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.  

      Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
      spells you know and replace it with another spell from your chosen spell list,
      which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.
  - name: Fighting Style
    level: 2
    description: >
      At #{ordinal} level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
      speciality.  Choose one of the following options.  You can't take a Fighting Style
      option more than once, even if you get to choose again later.

      ####Defense

      While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC

      ####Dueling

      When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other melee
      weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

      ####Great Weapon Fighting

      When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee
      weapon that you are wielding in two hands, you can reroll the die and must
      use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.  The weapon must have the
      two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

      ####Gunnery

      You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

      ####Two-Weapon Fighting

      When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier
      to the damage of the second attack.
  - name: Sense Cortex
    level: 3
    description: >
      Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can sense 'jack cortices within 20 feet and
      know whether or not they are active and whether or not they are currently
      being marshalled or controlled by a warcaster.  By using your action, you can
      expand this range to 100 feet for one round.
  - name: Jack Commander
    level: 3
    description: >
      At 3rd level, you gain a warjack that accompanies you on your adventures and
      fights alongside you.  Work with your DM to select and stat out a light warjack.
      Add your proficiency bonus to the 'jack's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls.  A
      'jack is extremely difficult to destroy completely, but if it suffers an amount of
      damage greater than 20 + four times your warcaster level, arcane feedback
      prevents you from controlling it until it has been repaired to within this limit
      and you have used an action to re-establish your link.  
      The 'jack obeys your commands as best it can.  It takes its turn on your
      initiative, but does not take an action unless you command it to.  On your turn,
      you can command the 'jack where to move without using an action.  You can
      use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or
      Help action.  Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one
      weapon attack yourself when you command your 'jack to take the Attack action.
  - name: Extra Attack
    level: 5
    description: >
      Beginning at #{ordinal} level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
      you take the Attack action on your turn.

  - name: Arcantrik Senses
    level: 18
    description: >
      At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures
      you can't see.  When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability
      to see it does not impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.  
      You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet
      of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded
      or deafened.
  - name: Overdrive
    level: 20
    description: >
      At 20th level, you can imbue your 'jack with a brief burst of energy.  Once on
      each of your turns, you can add your casting stat modifier to the attack roll or
      the damage roll of an attack made by a 'jack you are controlling.  You can
      choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the
      roll are applied.
